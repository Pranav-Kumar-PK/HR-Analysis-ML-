# HR-Analysis-ML-
HR Analytics_Case Study:

--> In this project I have modelled the probability of attrition in a company using a Logistic Regression model of Machine Learning and to understand what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay.

--> I have applied Data Science and Logistic Regression model of Machine Learning in this project.

--> I have also used Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the processed data.

--> Finally, I listed out all the reasons responsible for the increased attrition rate in the company.
